Hi! I am a PhD student at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes){:target="_blank"} in [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team, supervised by [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Stéphane Girard](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/girard/){:target="_blank"}, and Anne Dutfoy.

I am interested in systems at the intersection of statistics and computation, to have analytical insights on real-world applications. 
My PhD is funded by EDF R&D : I investigate how to combine bayesian computation with statistics of extreme values for the analysis of environmental data. 
Before, in 2020, I did a Master at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/){:target="_blank"} with [Daniel Aloise](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/aloise-daniel){:target="_blank"} where I explore methods to predict locational choices of a customer in a hall.
At the same time, I obtained an engineering degree at [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/){:target="_blank"} (Grenoble).
