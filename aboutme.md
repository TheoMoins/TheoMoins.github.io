Hi(!)[pierreclavier.github.io/aboutme] I am a PhD student at [Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) in [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team, advised by [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/), [Stéphane Girard](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/girard/), and Anne Dutfoy.

I am interested by systems at the intersection of statistics and computation, to have analytical insights on real-world applications. 
My PhD is funded by EDF R&D : I investigate how to combine bayesian computation with statistics of extreme values for the analysis of environmental data. 
Before, in 2020, I did a Master at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) with [Daniel Aloise](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/aloise-daniel) where I explore methods to predict locational choices of a customer in a hall.
At the same time, I obtained an engineering degree at [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) (Grenoble).
